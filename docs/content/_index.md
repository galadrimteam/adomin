# Introduction

{{< br >}}

Adomin is a starting point for creating a custom backoffice for your Adonis application.

It is composed of two main parts:

- backend files that will be copied on your adonis backend
- a react/vite frontend repository to clone

{{< br >}}

Adomin is **NOT** a library. It's a backoffice system that you can copy and paste into your Adonis apps.

You can think of it like [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs) but for Adonis backoffice.

{{< br >}}

Adomin is meant to be used as a base for a quick and solid backoffice with the ability to add infinite customisations.

It is for developers that are ready to **own** the code that they will copy paste.

We won't be able to provide support for every bug or new feature that you might want.

That said, do not hesitate to post your issues [here](https://github.com/galadrimteam/adomin/issues)
