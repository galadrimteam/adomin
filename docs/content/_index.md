# Introduction

Adomin is a starting point for creating a custom backoffice for your Adonis application it is composed of:

- backend files that will be imported on your adonis backend
- a react/vite frontend repository to clone

Adomin is for grown up people that are ready to **OWN** the code that they will download.
If you want a software with easy update, Adomin is **NOT** for you.
Adomin is meant to be used as a base for a quick and solid backoffice with the ability to add infinite customisations (you own the code)

Without style changes, it looks like this:
