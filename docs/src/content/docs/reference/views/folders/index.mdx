Folder views allows to organize your other views in a tree structure.

![Folder view](~/assets/images/reference/folders/folder_view.png)

## Config

To declare a folder view, you will need to add a `FolderViewConfig` object inside the `views` array of the `app/adomin/config/adomin_config.ts` file.

```ts
export const ADOMIN_CONFIG: AdominConfig = {
	title: 'Adomin',
	views: [MY_FOLDER_CONFIG],
}
```

Use the `createFolderViewConfig` function to create your `FolderViewConfig` object:

```ts
export const MY_FOLDER_CONFIG = createFolderViewConfig({
  label: 'My folder',
  name: 'my-folder',
  views: [STATS_CONFIG, USER_CONFIG],
  icon: 'folder',
})
```

You can pass the following options inside the config object:

### label

Title of the folder, displayed in the sidebar

### name
Used to determine the path in the frontend

e.g. if name = 'test', full path on the frontend will be `/adomin/folders/test`

### views

The folder children views, each object should be a `ModelConfig`, `StatsViewConfig` or `FolderViewConfig`

### visibilityCheck

Check if logged in user can see this folder

### isHidden

Use this if you want to hide this folder on the frontend.
Frontend routes will still be created and available, but the navbar won't show them.

:::caution
Do not see this as a protection, but rather a cosmetic feature.

If you want to protect things, use [visibilityCheck](#visibilityCheck)
:::

### icon

Icon name, by default this uses Tabler icons
