With Adomin, you can also easily add your own completely custom views.

## Config

First, remember that your frontend is a basic react app with react-router, so if you add this at the end of your [router.tsx](https://github.com/galadrimteam/adomin-frontend/blob/main/src/router.tsx) file

```tsx
export const adominRoutes = createBrowserRouter([
  // ... all adomin routes
  {
    path: '/your/custom/view',
    element: <h1>Hello world</h1>,
  },
]);
```

and you visit the path `/your/custom/view` in your browser, you will see the text "Hello world"

But if you do just that, you will see some problems:
- when you are on another page, you don't have a link to your custom view
- when you are on the custom view, you don't have the sidebar / header / footer of your backoffice

To solve the first point, you can totally just hack a bit the [sidebar.tsx](https://github.com/galadrimteam/adomin-frontend/blob/main/src/pages/home/Sidebar.tsx) file to add a link to your custom view, but it's a bit tedious and not very clean.

The way to go is to first add a custom view config on the backend side like this:

```ts
export const ADOMIN_CONFIG: AdominConfig = {
  title: 'Adomin',
  views: [
		// ... your other views
    createCustomViewConfig({
      href: '/your/custom/view',
      label: 'Custom page example',
      name: 'custom-page-example',
    }),
  ],
}
```

This will add a link to your custom view in the sidebar.

Note that you can make it have an icon with the `icon` property, like for all the other type of views.

Now that we fixed the first problem, let's tackle the second one.

In order to have a custom view that uses the same layout as the rest of your backoffice, you can wrap your component like this:

```tsx
<CustomPage currentView={"custom-page-example"}>
	<YourComponent />
</CustomPage>
```

:::note
ðŸ’¡ The `currentView` property should be the name of the view you added on the backend side (in the sidebar this will allow to highlight the current opened view).

You should take a look at the [CustomPageExample.tsx](https://github.com/galadrimteam/adomin-frontend/blob/main/src/pages/custom/CustomPageExample.tsx) file for a full custom view example.
