You might have some questions:

- how does the frontend routing work ?
- how to add custom routes ?

## Router file

It all begins with the **react-router-dom** router

import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

<FileTree>
  - src
    - [router.tsx](https://github.com/galadrimteam/adomin-frontend/blob/main/src/router.tsx) Frontend react-router-dom router
</FileTree>

Inside this file is all the routing

If this documentation is up to date ðŸ˜³, it will look like this:

```tsx
export const adominRoutes = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: '/',
    element: <Navigate to={ADOMIN_HOME_PATH} />,
  },
  {
    path: ADOMIN_HOME_PATH,
    element: <Navigate to={ADOMIN_FOLDERS_PATH} />,
  },
  {
    path: ADOMIN_FOLDERS_PATH,
    children: [
      {
        path: ':view',
        element: <FoldersPage />,
      },
    ],
    element: <HomePage />,
  },
  {
    path: ADOMIN_STATS_PATH,
    children: [
      {
        path: ':view',
        element: <StatsPage />,
      },
    ],
    element: <HomePage />,
  },
  {
    path: ADOMIN_MODELS_PATH,
    children: [
      {
        path: ':view',
        children: [
          { index: true, element: <ModelListPage /> },
          { path: 'create', element: <CreateModelPage /> },
          { path: ':primaryKeyValue', element: <EditModelPage /> },
        ],
        element: <ModelsPageLayout />,
      },
    ],
    element: <HomePage />,
  },
  {
    path: ADOMIN_LOGIN_PATH,
    element: <LoginPage />,
  },
])
```

You can see that it is creating dynamic paths, those paths will be determined with your backend adomin config.

To be clear, if you do not change the variables inside [adominPaths.ts](https://github.com/galadrimteam/adomin-frontend/blob/main/src/adominPaths.ts), the following paths are created:

```bash
/ # this path just redirects to /adomin, you can customize/remove this behaviour if you don't like it
/login

/backoffice/folders/:view # this dynamic path renders a folder view, which will redirect you to the nearest non-folder view
/backoffice/stats/:view # this dynamic path renders a stat view

/backoffice # this path adds a layout around the children of this route
/backoffice/:model # this is the list page
/backoffice/:model/create # this is the create page
/backoffice/:model/:primaryKeyValue # this is the update page
```

and here is an example if you configured adomin with the User model

```bash
/backoffice/User
/backoffice/User/create
/backoffice/User/1 # page to update user with id = 1
```

## Custom routes and overrides

If you want to override some page, let's say the create and the update page for your resource User, you will be able to do so by using the `makeOverridePage` helper, then put it somewhere in the router config, here is an example:

```tsx
export const adominRoutes = createBrowserRouter([
  // default adomin config
  // ...

  // your config
  makeOverridePage({ model: 'User', type: 'create' }, <MyOverridePage />),
  makeOverridePage({ model: 'User', type: 'update' }, <MyOverridePage2 />),
  makeOverridePage({ model: 'User', type: 'list' }, <MyOverridePage3 />),
])
```

:::note
ðŸ’¡ the `makeOverridePage` helper just creates a `RouteObject` wrapping the override component with a `CustomPage`, you can do it manually if you want more control:

```tsx
{
	path: "/backoffice/User/create",
	element:
	  <CustomPage currentView="User">
	    <MyOverridePage />
	  </CustomPage>,
}
```

:::note
If you want to add a completely custom view, you should see the [custom views](/adomin/reference/views/custom/) reference
